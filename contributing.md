# Contributing

This is still an early stage project, and as such all contributions are welcome! There are multiple ways in which you could contribute -- integrating a new service, adding new endpoints to an existing service, writing a workflow or a recipe using the already integrated endpoints etc. Or add tests! 

Please follow the following guidelines while making contributions:

1. For major changes like integrating a new service, please open a github issue so that the work is tracked. This way if someone else is already working on a service, there won't be any duplicated efforts.
2. Fork the repo, and open a pull request against the main branch.

Use the `requirements.txt` file to set up the code environment. I highly recommend using virtualenv.
